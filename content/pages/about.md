Hi! I’m Cem, a software engineer with a passion for dissecting how technology connects us, literally. By day, I design and optimize WiFi systems and routing solutions for a corporate tech company, ensuring networks stay robust, intelligent and user-friendly. By night (and weekends), I’m a tinkerer: you’ll find me prototyping microcontroller-based gadgets, automating my home lab or diving into Linux kernel quirks.

My career began in mechanical engineering, where I spent years learning to see systems as interconnected puzzles: a mindset I now apply to software and networking. While I no longer work in that field professionally, its lessons in precision and holistic problem-solving remain my secret sauce for tackling technical challenges.

This blog is where I share knowledge from the trenches of network engineering, WiFi deep dives and Linux wizardry. From step-by-step guides to dissecting protocols like a tech surgeon, plus anger management for devices stuck in their villain era (*they-who-must-not-behave*). I’ll also sprinkle in DIY electronics projects, because nothing beats the thrill of making hardware and software play nice.

If you’re here for career advice, don’t expect a traditional roadmap. My path has been anything but linear and I’m a firm believer that curiosity, not titles, drives meaningful growth.

Let’s geek out about WiFi mysteries, Linux hacks or why your router secretly hates you. Comment, rant or lurk guilt-free. Either way, welcome to the chaos!
